- pretty fun, never actually implemented a chart before. it was fun simply serializing the data for the chart.
- i wouldn't usually simply use fetch and handle my own loading, error states, etc., but for simplcity it works.
- i decided to only use next.js for both the client and api rather than nest.js. again, for simplicity and time.
- the simple `gpt-3.5-turbo` route can become an issue at some point where there are too much student feedback, where a text splitter would be needed, which is actually pretty straight forward to implement with Vercel's AI SDK.
